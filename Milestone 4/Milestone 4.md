| *Save Page displays article as well. Some actions are yet to be implemented such as remove saved article button* |

3. For milestone 4, we made each article more readable by adding a black background between the text and background image. We have also made the text bolder for readability. The default WPM is now also visible.
4. - (1) Users can speed-read articles using the Read button
  - (2) Users can save articles for later using the Star button
5. Click the Read button to demo the speed-reader
6. Our app is intended to improve reading efficiency of users with dyslexia. Speed-reading is a proven method to accomplish this.
7. The code for the speed-reader can be found in speedreader.js
8. We dynamically load the contents of each article when the Read button is pressed.
9. Click the Star button to demo saving an article (which will be visible on Saved Page)
10. Our app intends to provide quality reading material for users with dyslexia. Saving articles to reread later is essential.
11. The code for saving articles can be found in speedreader.js, savedarticle.js, and app.js
12. The process of saving articles include calling our external firebase database and writing/getting documents from said database.
