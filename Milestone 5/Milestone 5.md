1. Milestone5.md is present in our repo
2. Our targer demographic encompasses dyslexic people trying to improve their reading skills. Most speed reading tools for dyslexics require a user to input what they want to be read before it begins. We solve this hindrance by automatically presenting users with pre-made speed readers based on current news articles. We chose to use news articles to present current and always-changing, relevant information to the user. The users improve their speed reading skills and learn about current events without having to rely on multiple apps to do so.
3. Current UI shots:

| *This was our previous UI which included our demo speed reader and allowed the user to test the speed reader.* |

|:--:|
| *The new updated version allows the user to change the WPM speed and font. This edition also allows the user to add whatever they like to the text box to create their own speed reader.* |

4. The screenshots in Milestone 4 were for our main page which included the news articles. We added more functionality by including a custom speed reader in the Demo page which is shown in the second screenshot.
5. Screenshot of data visualization:

| *Data is shown as individual articles in jumbotrons with each article getting its own box. Each box is shown with Article title, content, time to read the article, and a picture from the article as the background* |

6. We hooked up to Google's News API to pull trending articles. We used the Title, description, Content, and background image to populate each article box.
