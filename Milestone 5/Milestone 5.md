1. Milestone5.md is present in our repo
2. Our targer demographic encompasses dyslexic people trying to improve their reading skills. Most speed reading tools for dyslexics require a user to input what they want to be read before it begins. We solve this hindrance by automatically presenting users with pre-made speed readers based on current news articles. We chose to use news articles to present current and always-changing, relevant information to the user. The users improve their speed reading skills and learn about current events without having to rely on multiple apps to do so.
