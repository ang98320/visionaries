1. milestone2.md is present in our repo
2. Our idea is based on our idea present in the first milestone: a speed-reader designed for dyslexic readers to improve their reading efficiency. Please note that the prototypes in our milestone1 reflect a different idea which we are no longer pursuing.

| *3c. This is our speed-reader which presents words one at a time* |

4. As noted earlier, our screenshots are completely different from the prototypes in milestone1. This is because we changed our idea from an OCR reader to a speed-reader.
5. Will demonstrate on localhost
6. We call a news api which returns a list of trending articles in json format. We then load the json into our front-end. (We will explain this more to our TA)
7. Yes: can navigate to all pages from home page
8. See Above
9. See Above
10. See Above
11. See Above
12. The read button will select the content of its respective article, open the speed-reader, and speed-read the content.
13. The core functionality is implemented in our app. We may need to find other apis for reading content.
14. Yes, we can explain how the Ajax interaction works.
15. We will be using apis that provide articles/reading content to populate our website.
